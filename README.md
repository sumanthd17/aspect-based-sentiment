# Targeted Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis

### The goal of this project is to predict the aspect and the sentiment of a given text and a defined target in the text

## Hypothesis
> By converting the given text into sentence pair QA dataset will help in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and summarizing the classifcation results can help in understanding the aspect
